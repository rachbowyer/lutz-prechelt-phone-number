On this [blog](https://norvig.com/java-lisp.html), Peter Norvig describes some research on the effectiveness of programming languages for application development carried out by Lutz Prechelt and Ron Garret. Research subjects were asked to implement a program that met a specific specification. This repo contains two implementations of the program:


1. [My implementation in Clojure](https://github.com/rachbowyer/lutz-prechelt-phone-number/tree/main/rachel)
2. [Peter Norvig's implementation in Common Lisp](https://github.com/rachbowyer/lutz-prechelt-phone-number/tree/main/norvig)


See my [blog](https://www.bowyer.info/post/developer-productivity) for more information.
